Employee Management System-

The Employee Management System is a console-based Java application that allows you to manage employee records using a text file as storage. This application provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting employee records.

Features-

Add Employee: Allows you to add a new employee to the system by entering their ID, name, and salary. It checks for duplicate employee IDs to ensure uniqueness.

Display Employee: Displays the existing employee records stored in the system. It reads the records from the text file and prints them on the console.

Update Employee: Enables you to update the details of an existing employee based on their ID. You can modify their name and salary, and the changes will be saved to the file.

Delete Employee: Allows you to remove an employee from the system based on their ID. The corresponding record will be deleted from the file.

Exit: Terminates the program and exits.
